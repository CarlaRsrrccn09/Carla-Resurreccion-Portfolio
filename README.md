Reflection: 
In creating my personal portfolio, I applied several UI/UX principles
to ensure a clean, organized, and user-friendly design. I focused on 
consistency by using a uniform color scheme and font style across all
pages. Navigation was made simple with a clear menu structure so 
visitors can easily access sections like About Me, Projects, and Contact.
I also made the site responsive, so it works well on both desktop and 
mobile devices, improving accessibility and overall user experience.

One challenge I faced was setting up GitHub Pages correctly.
At first, my site returned a 404 error because the index.html 
file was inside the wrong folder. I solved this by learning that
GitHub Pages only serves files from the root or /docs folder, 
and then reorganizing my files so the live site would load properly.
Another challenge was linking CSS and JavaScript files correctly
after moving folders. I fixed this by adjusting the relative paths
in my HTML files, ensuring styles and interactivity worked as intended.

If I were to improve the portfolio next, I would add more interactive
features, such as smooth animations or hover effects, to make the 
site more engaging. I would also expand the Projects section with 
detailed descriptions and screenshots for each project. Additionally,
integrating a functional contact form would allow visitors to easily
reach me, further enhancing the usability of the site.
